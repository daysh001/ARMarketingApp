# ARMarketingApp
A marketing AR app developed in Unity using C# and ARCore for Andoid. It features the Microsoft Arc Mouse as the marketed product - the user can interact with the product in various different ways (place, move, scale, rotate, view model, etc.) and is also provided with important specifications and descriptions.
 
 This project is the primary research for my dissertation, it was also chosen to be presented at the Lancaster University Conference 2021.
